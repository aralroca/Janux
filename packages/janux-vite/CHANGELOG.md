# @janux/vite

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- `worker()` — a new `janux/worker` entry point that runs a function on a Web Worker thread, so expensive work stops
  blocking clicks, typing, scrolling and animation. It is marked **experimental** in `STABILITY.md`: the worker is
  emitted by a source transform because Vite cannot emit a worker chunk from a plugin, and that strategy is expected
  to change under the API.

### Patch Changes

- `janux dev` shows a failure inside an `intent()`, `effect()` or `source()` with the chain that explains it — route,
  `_layout` chain, island, the named behavior, and, for an invocation, the guard the pipeline resolved and the origin
  it resolved it for — above the JS stack. The original error is still logged to the console, which a failed intent
  previously never reached. The overlay is dev-only and eliminated from production builds.

  Sourcemaps are on: full in dev, with the framework's own frames resolvable, and `hidden` in production, so `.map`
  files exist for an error tracker without a `sourceMappingURL` reaching the browser.

  `janux info` prints versions, the resolved config, detected adapters, active zero-config integrations and every
  route as markdown to paste into an issue unedited.

- The published packages ship compiled ESM with declarations and sourcemaps, instead of manifests pointing at
  TypeScript source. Node refuses to strip types under `node_modules`, so every earlier release was unloadable from a
  plain Node project; a Node install smoke test now runs on every change so it cannot regress.
- Strict CSP: `csp: true` mints a nonce per request and stamps it on every inline script and style the framework
  emits — resume payload, island map, runtime, speculation rules, query hydration, suspense boundary swaps, inlined
  CSS, JSON-LD, `meta.head` and `<script>`/`<style>` written in JSX — then sends
  `script-src 'nonce-…' 'strict-dynamic'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'`. No code path uses `eval` or
  `new Function`, so `'unsafe-eval'` is never needed, and an app that does not configure `csp` gets byte-identical
  HTML.

  SPA navigation is where this is easy to get wrong: re-creating the scripts a navigated page brings is what gives
  them a valid nonce, so doing it indiscriminately would launder an injected `<script>` into an executed one. The
  response states its own nonce in `x-janux-nonce`, out of reach of its own markup, and only tags already carrying
  that value are re-stamped. Nonces are validated against the CSP `base64-value` grammar, and a nonced document is
  never kept in the shared response cache — a stored nonce is one every later visitor would share.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- Suspense-only pages ship their runtime: the build catalogs islands instead of inferring them from components.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- The response body is piped to Node instead of buffered.
